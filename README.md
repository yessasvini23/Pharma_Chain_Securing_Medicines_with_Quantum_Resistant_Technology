# 🔬 PharmaChain: Securing Medicines with Quantum-Resistant Technology

> A next-generation pharmaceutical authentication platform leveraging **quantum-safe blockchain**, **mobile vision AI**, **micro-optics tags**, and **DeFi incentives** to combat counterfeit drugs — particularly in high-risk regions like Africa and Asia.

---

## 🌍 Overview

Every year, over **1 million lives are lost due to counterfeit medicines**. PharmaChain addresses this global health crisis by embedding each drug batch with a **quantum-resistant NFT** and a **scannable physical micro-tag**, allowing consumers and healthcare workers to verify authenticity instantly via mobile AI.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔐 **Quantum-Safe Blockchain (QRL / IOTA):** Immutable drug identity records resistant to quantum attacks  
- 🧬 **NFT-Backed Drug Authentication:** Each drug is linked to a tamper-proof, verifiable token  
- 🧠 **Mobile Vision AI:** Real-time image-based verification via smartphone  
- 🛰️ **Micro-Optics Tags:** Tamper-evident, scannable packaging markers  
- 💰 **DeFi Bounties:** Community incentives for verifying drugs and reporting counterfeits  
- 📈 **Global Health Impact Dashboard:** Real-time tracking of verifications, reports, and lives saved

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Registration:** Pharma companies mint quantum-resistant NFTs linked to drug metadata.  
2. **Tagging:** Micro-optics labels are generated with embedded security features.  
3. **Verification:** End-users scan the drug using a mobile app with built-in AI.  
4. **Reward System:** Verified users earn tokens; counterfeit reporters receive bounties.  
5. **Dashboard:** Tracks user activity, drug stats, and impact metrics.
